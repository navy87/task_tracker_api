# Task Tracker API

This is a SpringBoot Backend API, for Task Tracker Web App [link](https://github.com/yahyafati/task_tracker_react)

This is the backend made for the frontend. I don't know how to write these things ðŸ‘‹

This is an API which can be used to track tasks for an organization. It will help track tasks of different members of a group. Okay, just try it, I can't.
